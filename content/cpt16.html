  <h2>Chapter 16 - Fundamentals of EDM Rhythm</h2>
   <p></p>
	<p class="Aligned">Rhythm forms the very core of all electronic dance music and therefore its a theory that all dance musicians should become accustomed too. The manipulation of basic rhythmic theory details the very basis of every dance music record and this now involves much more than relying on a simple four to the floor rhythms. </p>

<h3>Basic Triplet Effect</h3>
 <p></p>
  <p class="prefix">Hi-Hat Drum Triplet</p>
   <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/triplet1.mp3" controls="controls">

     </audio></p>
<p class="Aligned">In the above example, a hi-hat pattern plays the triplet effect over a standard 1/16th closed hi-hat pattern. The example starts with all of the hats located centrally but over time, the triplet effect moves to the left for a short period to help in identifying its rhythm. Note how the triplet adds a rhythmical surge to the drum loop.</p>

<h3>Asymmetrical Triplet Effect</h3>
 <p></p>
  <p class="prefix">An Asymmetrical Triplet</p>
   <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/triplet2.mp3" controls="controls">

     </audio></p>
<p class="Aligned">This drum pattern begins as the previous employing a complete triplet rhythm on a closed hi-hat. However, after a short period notes are removed from the triplet pattern leaving only three hits on the triplet grid per beat of the bar. This sparser triplet rhythm modifies the motion and feel of the drum loop and introduces a different style of rhythmical surge. </p>


<h3>Asymmetrical Resolution</h3>
 <p></p>
  <p class="prefix">Asymmetrical subdivision of beats and bars</p>

     </audio></p>
<p class="Aligned">In this example, the piano is employed to denote the four beats of the bar with one quarter note for each beat. A bass instrument is introduced that is not subdivided across the grid like the piano and employs a series of dotted eighth notes followed by a quarter note at the end. Some dotted eighth notes cross the beats of the bar creating a syncopated feel to the music, whilst the final quarter note breaks with the convention that it is composed entirely of dotted eighths.</p>
	   
	
<h3>Polyrhythm Example 1</h3>
 <p></p>
  <p class="prefix">Polyrhythm on a bass instrument</p>
   <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/polyrhythm.mp3" controls="controls">
    Your browser does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer.
     </audio></p>
<p class="Aligned">Polyrhythm in electronic dance music can be a complex yet important effect. In this example, the piano is a quarter note in length and denotes a 4/4 rhythm to the listener. When the bass is introduced, however, it dictates a 5/4 signature. </p>
<p class="Aligned">In the 5/4 signature, the bass pattern is a beat longer than the piano and overlays the signature dictated by the piano. This results in a complex rhythmical interplay between the two and is a fundamental technique to the production of electronic dance music. </p>

<h3>Polyrhythm Example 2</h3>
 <p></p>
  <p class="prefix">Polyrhythm on a bass instrument</p>
   <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/polyrhythm2.mp3" controls="controls">
    Your browser does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer.
     </audio></p>
<p class="Aligned">In this second example, the bass and piano order is reversed. Note how the bass appears to dictate the rhythm of the music and its only when the piano is introduced that we begin to question the time signature. This is a striking effect and very common in the production of dance music. </p>

<p class="Aligned">In both examples, by employing the piano as a lead instrument in 4/4 and the bass in 5/4, it has resulted in a particularly severe effect that is easily noticeable. Typically in many tracks, the 5/4 would be applied to less important instruments so as not to confuse the signature so strongly. </p>
