26 - Formal Structure</h2> <p></p> <p class="Aligned">Beyond sound
design, processing, effects and composition lies the formal structure or
arrangement of the music. This can be viewed as the wrapping or method
of delivering your ideas to the listening audience. However, since
electronic dance music often relies on a single idea, its formal
structure is unlike many other styles of music and relies on continual
development of a theme rather than the atypical verse and chorus
structure.</p>

<h3>Percussive Call And Response</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Call and
Response In Percussion</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/responseperc.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser does
not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet
Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">Call and Response can occur in
all instruments and in the more percussive orientated genres of
electronic dance music (Techno, Tech House, Tech Step, Minimal etc) it
is common to employ this in the percussive timbres. In the above
example, the snare/clap has its own call and response system to add
interest to the loop. This is slowly panned to the left during the
course of loop to help you hear the effect.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Using Filters to Create
Builds</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/filterup.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">Filters are perhaps the most fundamental tool in a
producers arsenal when it comes to the production of an arrangement and
building or releasing tension. In the above example, a low-pass filter
opening produces the increasing tension to the mix.</p>

<h3>Different Intros</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Different Intros</p>
<p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/buildex.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">In the above example, a reverse crash is used first to
introduce the hi-hats. This is followed by a high pass filter employed
on the sub bass that results in the higher frequencies of the bass
entering the mix first. After this, the same style of high pass filter
is employed on the open hi-hats, closely followed by a reverse reverb on
the secondary bass.</p>

<p class="Aligned">Please note that in this example, I have kept all the
introductions close together in order to reduce the examples time. In a
real-world example, each of these introductions would likely occur 8 or
16 bars apart.</p>

<h3>Bass Line Syncopation</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Syncopation
Through Velocity</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/syncopation.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser does
not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet
Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">In the above example, the bass
line's frequency cut-off is mapped to respond to velocity (the harder
the note is struck, the more the filter opens). Here, the first 8 bars
maintain the same velocity but in the next 8 bars the second note in
each bar is treated to a higher velocity.</p>

<p class="Aligned">The 8 bars following this have the third note of the
bar treated to velocity and then for the final 8 bars, the fourth note
in each receives velocity. Note how the frequency change creates a
moving syncopation within the bass, introducing a new rhythmical feel
every 8 bars. </p>

<h3>Bass Line Pitch Development</h3> <p></p> <p
class="prefix">Development of Pitch</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/pitchdevelopment.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser
does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or
Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">In the above example,
a reverse crash is used to introduce a change and this is followed by a
pitch development in the bass line.</p> 

<h3>Syncopated Canonic</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Canonic
Movement</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/canonic.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">Listen carefully to the above example. The Canonic (the
low frequency drone that is introduced) dictates the upcoming pitch
motion of the bass whilst the bass itself remains at the same pitch.
Later in the example, both the canonic and the bass converge, both
moving in pitch. This is a popular technique in Swedish House but is
slowly being adopted into other genres.</p>

<h3>Automated Effects</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Building
Effects</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/effectsbuild.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">Effects can also be used with building tension. In the
above example, both reverb decay time and delay time were increased via
automation. Listening to the effect, the reverb begins to swamp the lead
timbre, producing an almost pad style feel to the lead. This technique
is commonly used in progressive house. </p>

<p class="Aligned"> NOTE: Typically this style of effect is underlined
by an additional building effect such as a noise riser, drum or snare
roll or reverse cymbal. I left these out so you could concentrate on the
effect but I would suggest you trying this technique with further
underlying elements. </p> 

<h3>Denial of Expectation</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Employing a
Denial</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/denial.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">In the above example, the track builds up using a number
of techniques giving the expectation to the listener that the track is
about to evolve. Whilst it does evolve slightly, its less than expected
and results in the denial, increasing the excitement of the
listener.</p> 

<h3>Snare Roll</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">A Basic MIDI Snare
Roll</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/snareroll_1.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">The above example is of a simple snare roll, programmed
in MIDI and increasing in volume through the use of velocity.</p>

<h3>Snare Roll & Effects</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Snares with
Reverb, Delay & Phaser</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/snareroll_2.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser does
not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet
Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">The above example is of the
same snare roll, programmed in MIDI and increasing in volume through the
use of velocity. However, this time it has been treated to delay, reverb
and a (very) small amount of phaser.</p>

<h3>Snares In the Mix</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">In The Right
Context</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/snareroll_3.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.
Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p
class="Aligned">You can only really appreciate the use of snare rolls
when employed in context of a complete mix. Here, I've added them to
help increase the building feel of a mix.</p>

<h3>A Finale</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Mix Finale (Recapitulation)
with a Single Bar Denial</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/recap.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser does not
support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or Internet
Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">In the above example, the
snare roll and opening filter are used to create the uplifting tension
to the recapitulation of the track. However, this is followed by a
single bar denial before the recapitulation begins.</p>
