25 - Recording Vocals</h2> <p></p> 

<h3>Note:</h3> <p></p> <p class="Aligned">Due
to copyright issues, the audio content described in the book for this particular chapter could not be used so
we're using different vocals, provided by Amy.</p> 

<p class="Aligned">Recording Vocals for electronic dance music doesn't require a
professional studio or excessively priced equipment and it is perfectly
possible to record them on a budget. All the examples on this page were
recorded in a typical kitchen with a tiled floor (the best room we could
find for maximum reverberations and sonic reflections). The vocals were
recorded with an SE Z5600 valve microphone and Focusrite ISA One
Pre-Amp. For sound protection, we employed home made Gobo's and the SE
"reflexion" filter.</p>

	<h3>Note:</h3> <p></p> <p class="Aligned">Please consider that these
	vocals are "as is" with absolutely no processing or "comping".
	Consequently, they may sound particularly "raw" since almost every
	vocalist is commonly treated to an absolute minimum of vocal
	"comping" (selecting the best parts of numerous vocal takes),
	auto-tuning, compression and reverb. I would like to thank Amy for
	her bravery in permitting me to use single vocal takes with no prior
	comping, correcting or processing whatsoever. Remember that the
	purpose of this exercise is not to concentrate on the performance
	but the sonic reflections of the room and how they're affected by
	the filters.</p> <!-- Insert Media -->

<h3>Bare Vocals</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">No Filters</p> <p
class="Aligned"><audio src="media/content/recording_1.mp3"
controls="controls"> Your browser does not support the MP3 format.

class="Aligned">The above example is a recording taken using nothing
more than the SE Z5600 valve microphone in a cradle with a pop shield
and a Focusrite ISA ONE pre-amplifier. Listen to the sonic reflections
and reverberation returning to the microphone..</p>


<h3>Reflexion Filter</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Introducing a
Reflexion Filter</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/recording_2.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser
does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or
Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">For this next example
we introduced the SE reflexion filter. Again, listen to how this filter
reduces the sonic reflections and reverberations of the room. There are
still reverberations present but they have been reduced.</p>

<h3>Gobo's Only</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Removing the reflexion
filter and employing Gobos instead</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/recording_3.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser
does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or
Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">In the above example,
we removed the reflexion filter and relied entirely on the Gobo's. These
have perhaps the most significant effect on the recording, massively
reducing the sonic reverberation and reflections from the flat walls and
tiled floor of the kitchen.</p>

<h3>Reflexion Filter and Gobo's</h3> <p></p> <p class="prefix">Both
Reflexion and Gobo's Together</p> <p class="Aligned"><audio
src="media/content/recording_4.mp3" controls="controls"> Your browser
does not support the MP3 format. Please use Google Chrome, Safari or
Internet Explorer. </audio></p> <p class="Aligned">In this final
example, we employ both reflexion filter and Gobos. Combined these
produce the most effective treatment resulting in a sonic character with
very little of the rooms natural character, resulting in vocals that are
easier to mix.</p>  </div>
