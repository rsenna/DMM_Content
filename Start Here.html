<!-- Main Body Text -->  <div id="CONTENT"> <div id="MAIN"> <h2>Dance
Music Manual - 4th Edition</h2> <p></p> <p class="Aligned">This content
is designed to be used in conjunction with the fourth edition of the
Dance Music Manual. If you do not yet own or have not yet began to read
it, I would strongly suggest reading the relevant chapters in the book
before starting with this content.</p>

<p class="Aligned">You can purchase it <a href="https://www.trainyourears.com/">HERE</a></p>

	<p class="Aligned">Each chapters content can be accessed using the
	chapter links to the left. All of the audio examples included here
	were compressed into mp3 format in order to reduce the download size
	and therefore to gain the most from this content, it should be
	viewed in Google's Chrome, Safari, Opera or Internet Explorer. Other
	browsers may not play the content correctly.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">Note that the audio examples contained herein are
	simply that; examples. They have not been mastered and are not to
	state that "This is how it should be done" but rather "This is how
	its currently done". They are simply included to show how the
	techniques described in the manual make a difference to a musical
	production. It is up to you to show us how it is done in the
	future.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">Perhaps more importantly, Electronic Dance Music
	has become a truly disparate genre. It has fragmented with a
	diversity no-one could have imagined twenty years ago but it has
	also resulted in countless immaterial arguments over what
	constitutes specific genres. This only serves to draw attention away
	from the goal of actually creating music and is not the focus of the
Manual or these examples. If you wish to argue semantics there
	are many public forums available on the world wide web to waste your
	time on.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">Truly successful producers and artists are those
	that have looked beyond themselves and their egos and focused on the
	music, ideas, production and techniques employed in any and all
	genres. Without this attitude, dance music would not have developed
	nor survived with the success it has today. Unquestionably, one of
	the biggest paths to a producers success is to open your mind as
	well as your ears.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">Finally, I would like to thank you for purchasing
	the Dance Music Manual. If you have enjoyed (or are enjoying the
	book) please leave a review at Amazon, BN.com or Goodreads etc. Just
	a few good reviews really can help in getting the word out about the
	Dance Music Manual. And if you have any questions regarding
	techniques or anything discussed in the book or in these examples,
	feel free to grab me on Facebook. I will
	always aim to answer any questions.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">If you haven't purchased the Manual but
	downloaded it for free; please do the right thing and buy it. I
	really do need your support with this. Its not about money, its
	about sales figures. Every sale makes a difference to the publishers
	acceptance of further editions and new volumes.</p>

	<p class="Aligned">Thank you.</p>
